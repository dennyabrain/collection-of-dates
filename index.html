            <h1>A collection of some consequential and inconsequential dates</h1>

            <h4>26 December 2016</h4>
            <p>I feel slightly bothered by the fact that you did not wish me on Christmas.</p>

            <h4>29 December 2016</h4>
            <p>I begin thinking that you never really were a Chrismas wisher, anyway. So maybe I should not be that upset anyway.</p>

            <h4>1st January 2017</h4>
            <p>I realize that I forgot to wish you on your birthday and so maybe I should not be upset AT ALL!</p>

            <h4>17th December 2016</h4>
            <p>I go to an art exhibition on digital surveillance and see some 3D-like postcards. I feel that I might be wrong and I am probably wrong but they look like something that a strange being like you may cherish. You probably would just go meh and toss them amongst a pile of nothings. Or possibly you would totally go berserk about how cool they are and send it to loved ones. There is a small chance that this is possibly one of the best things I could give you. Since that is a rare occasion I am willing to tell the convinience seeking side of my brain to lay low and make plans of posting these to you.</p>

            <h4>2nd July 2013</h4>
            <p>You tell me you like postcards.</p>

            <h4>4th August 2015</h4>
            <p>I receive a letter you wrote to me on the flight from India to Berkley and posted me from your new addres.</p>

            <h4>10th November 2014</h4>
            <p>The date I thought I would send you a bunch of gifts but the logistics of international postage seemed like the valid excuse (then) for me to not send you anything.</p>

            <h4>9th October 2015</h4>
            <p>I decided I should definitely send you something but what could I send that is not generic enough to feel meaningless and also not meaningful enough to feel like a subtle sublimal message :P</p>

            <h4>27th Decelber 2016</h4>
            <p>I watch a really good movie La La Land and think of you. I wanted to recommend you to watch it but am too taken over by my ego because of the fact that you did not wish me on Christmas :P</p>

            <h4>6th December 2016</h4>
            <p>You post your images of goodle timelapse on your blog that makes a light go off in my dumb head. Even though you are a nerd of many things, and since I don't share a lot of those passions with you, it is hard to place a finger on what physical object you might like. But is it possible that a LOTR reading, ursula le guin loving being might be into Maps? :O</p>

            <h4>17th December 2016</h4>
            <p>I ask the people at the art exhibition how much the postcards cost and then tell me they are for free. I fee a little sad because I really wanted to spend money on them. Because they felt like they would be worth it. I was willing to spend around 20 dollars for two postcard because I felt if you liked them they would be nice for you to keep one with yourself and send another one to a loved one. Since they were free I picked up all unique copies and also some not so good postcards coz I am sure you would want to send postcards to your not-that-much-loved-ones too :P</p>

            <h4>2nd January 2017</h4>
            <p>I post these lovely postcards in an envelope because I am too worried that if I post them actually as postcards they will get stolen coz they look so good.</p>

            <h4>1st January 2017</h4>
            <p>I finally figured out what the letter accompanying the postcards should be like.</p>

            <p>Happy Belated Birthday Tarunima. I hope you like these. Looking forward to hearing more stories from you at some point when our paths cross.</p>

            <p>P.S. 26h December is Your birthday. This one is not for you. It is more of a reminder to myself :P</p>
            <p>P.P.S.  I hope a song recommendation coming from post is doubly effective. Check out "Fools Who Dream" from the movie La La Land.</p>
            <p>P.P.P.S. I am doing this surprise thing for the first time so to put me at ease, just drop me an email or ping when you recieve this :)</p>
